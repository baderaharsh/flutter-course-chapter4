A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

###################################################################################
#Building the flutter app as being guided and taught by Maximilian Schwarzmuller
 
#The application is for adding/noting down all the transactions that we do on daily basis.

Step 1 - Built two cards. One kept as it and used second to display all the transactions. 
Step 2 - Created one List of Maps to store the transactions. By using map method, displayed these transactions separately on the invidual cards.
Step 3 - Developed two Text fields and set controllers for them to handle input data.
Step 4 - Split the widgets for clearing the Widget tree and complexity.
Step 5 - Add new items to list using Stateful Widget in UserTransactions file.
Step 6 - Add Scroll View for Home Screen.
Step 7 - Use ViewList.builder() for optimized list view for the items.
Step 8 - Numerical mode keyboard for amount field using TextInputType property.
Step 9 - On keyboard submit/done button adds item to list. Used onPressed property.
step 10 - Validation for submit. Amount value zero and/or empty text field will not  add item to the list
step 11 - Round off amount on submission for upto 2 digits after decimial point by using toStringAsFixed(2) property.
