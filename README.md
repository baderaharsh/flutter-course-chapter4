#Building the flutter app as being guided and taught by Maximilian Schwarzmuller

#The application is for adding/noting down all the transactions that we do on daily basis.

#Step 1 - Built two cards. One kept as it and used second to display all the transactions. 
Step 2 - Created one List of Maps to store the transactions. By using map method, displayed these transactions separately on the invidual cards.
Step 3 - Developed two Text fields and set controllers for them to handle input data.
Step 4 - Split the widgets for clearing the Widget tree and complexity.
